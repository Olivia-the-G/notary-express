## Description 
This is a note taking application that has fields for a note and a title, and allows you to save notes for future use. 

This application uses express.js and is deployed on Heroku. 

Making this project allowed me to learn more about http requests and communicating with the server which helps me on my way to becoming more skilled in back-end development.
